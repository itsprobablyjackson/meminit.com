## Google AdSense & Cookies

We use **Google AdSense** to serve ads. Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads based on a user’s previous visits to this and other websites.

Google’s use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to MeminIt and/or other sites on the internet.

You may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting the **[Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads)**.

## Information We Collect

We do not directly collect personal data such as your name, address, or phone number.

Some tools may temporarily use or store data to function properly (like image tools), but nothing is stored permanently or shared.

## Third-Party Services

In addition to Google Ads, we may use third-party tools (like analytics) to help improve the site. These tools may use cookies or similar technologies.

## Cloudflare Web Analytics

Cloudflare does **not use cookies** and does **not collect personal data** for tracking purposes. The analytics are used solely to improve site performance and understand general user behavior.
